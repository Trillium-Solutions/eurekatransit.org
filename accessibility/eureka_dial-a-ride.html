<h3>What is Dial-a-Ride?</h3>

<p>Dial-a-Ride is a door-to-door service available to those who cannot use public transportation.  This service is only provided to persons who have been certified.  Eligibility may be granted on a temporary or permanent basis.   Physicians will be asked to assist in making the determination of certification by completing a form describing the applicant's disability.  The final decision as to whether or not the applicant qualifies for Dial-a-Ride will be made by the certifying agency.</p>

<p>For questions, or to become certified for use of Dial-a-Ride, contact either the Senior Resource at 443-9747, Humboldt Transit Authority 443-0826, or the City of Eureka at 441-4117.</p>

<h3>How Much Does Dial-a-Ride Cost?</h3>

<p>Tickets are sold in books of six (6) for $18.  Please plan to have tickets before you call a cab, you cannot give the driver cash for Dial-a-Ride or Dial-a-Lift trips.</p>

<p>Note that on August 1st, 2012, there was an increase in Dial-a-Ride ticket costs.  We will only honor pre-increase “pink” dial-a-ride tickets thru September 1, 2012.  For those with large stock of tickets, please contact the HTA Office at 443-0826 for exchanging tickets on or before 9/01.  No Refunds are possible.</p>

<p>We appreciate your business and wish to provide the best customer service possible, and this includes making sure you are aware of any upcoming price changes.  We are committed to giving you the information you need.</p>

<p>We wish to thank you for your valued patronage and look forward to assisting you in your mobility needs.</p>


<h3>How does Dial-a-Ride Work?</h3>

<p>Dial-a-Ride is a shared ride service, which means that the driver may pick up or drop off other passengers before taking you to your destination.  To request a ride, contact <strong>City Cab at 442-4555</strong>.  For your convenience, the phone number is printed on the tickets.  Those who have folding wheelchairs and can transfer to a cab must use the regular cabs or mini-van instead of the Dial-a-Lift wheelchair van.  You must call 24 hours in advance and be ready to go when the vehicle arrives. Drivers will only be able to make one stop and each time you get into the cab it will count as a separate trip and require new tickets.</p>

<h3>How do I Get a Ride?</h3>

<p>Please call 442-4555 to schedule your ride 24 hours in advance. For appointments at a specific time reservations will be accepted as far as 14 days in advance.  When you call, please be ready to give the following information:</p>

<ul>
<li>your name</li>
<li>exact address where you want to be picked up</li>
<li>exact address of your destination</li>
<li>number of people who will be riding</li>
<li>whether you'll need a wheelchair-accessible vehicle</li>
</ul>
 
<p>Remember, since Dial-a-Ride is a shared-ride service, the driver may make other stops on the way to your destination. You are expected to ride with other passengers and the driver assigned to you by the dispatcher.</p>

<h3>Important Travel Tips</h3>

<ul>
<li>Remember to have your tickets ready. Drivers do not carry tickets for sale.</li>
<li>Be ready to go when you call. The driver can only wait three minutes without inconveniencing other passengers.</li>
<li>Allow plenty of time to get to and from your destination. Dial-a-Ride vehicles will probably stop to pick up and drop off other passengers on the way to your destination.</li>
<li>When possible, avoid traveling during peak weekday hours: 7 a.m. to 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. to 4 p.m. 	 Also bear in mind that the first five working days of the month are the busiest travel days.</li>
<li>If you can't make your trip, please call to cancel at least two hours before the scheduled pick-up time. This will help the driver avoid making unnecessary stops.</li>
<li>Each eligible passenger may bring up to three (3) shopping-sized bags weighing no more than 20 pounds each.</li>
<li>Drivers are not allowed to enter a passenger's residence for any reason. Drivers can, however, help carry packages to your door.</li>
<li>Smoking, eating, and drinking (except when drinks are in authorized containers) are not allowed in Dial-a-Ride vehicles.</li>
<li>Seat belts are required for all passengers riding in Dial-a-Ride vehicles. Please notify the driver if you require assistance buckling up.</li>
<li>Information on Dial-a-Ride schedules, fares, and services are subject to change.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Companions</h3>

<p>A companion is someone riding with a certified passenger, but not as a Personal Care Attendant (PCA). One companion is always allowed to ride with the certified passenger as long as a reservation has been made for the companion and the companion travels from the same point of origin and to the same destination. The companion pays the same fare as the certified passenger. More than one companion is allowed if space is available.</p>

<h3>Personal Care Attendants</h3>
<p>A Personal Care Attendant (PCA) is an individual who must accompany a passenger in order for the passenger to fulfill the purpose of his or her trip. For an individual to qualify as an attendant, the certified passenger must have established the need for a PCA during the ADA eligibility process. PCAs are always allowed to ride with an eligible passenger and are not required to pay a fare. They must, however, travel from the same point of origin and to the same destination as the ADA-certified passenger.</p>

<h3>Children</h3>
<p>Passengers traveling with young children are responsible for providing infant/booster car seats, in accordance with state law.</p> 

<h3>What Can I Expect?</h3>
<p><strong>ADA:</strong> Dial-a-Ride ADA service is considered "on time" if the vehicle arrives at the pickup point five minutes before or up to thirty minutes after the agreed-upon pickup time.</p>

<p>In-vehicle ride time will vary by service area and according to the distance traveled.</p>

<p>Please remember that the driver can only wait three minutes without inconveniencing other passengers.</p>

<h3>Passenger Responsibilities</h3>

<p>It is the policy of Dial-a-Ride to ensure the safe and effective transportation of all its passengers and the safe and effective operation of all its vehicles.  To this end, the following passenger responsibilities have been established to fairly represent actions that would ensure the safe and effective transportation of all riders; however, they are not meant to be all inclusive.</p>

<p>City Cab complies with the ADA Transportation for Individuals with Disabilities Guidelines provided by the Federal Transit Administration, and the Department of Transportation.  City Cab reserves the right to deny service for non-compliance with any of the following:</p>

<h4>Appropriate Social Behavior</h4>
<p>All passengers, including City Cab staff, have the right to participate without the threat or fear of physical or verbal abuse and with the maximum of personal comfort.  Passengers are therefore expected to exhibit appropriate social behavior while interacting with other passengers and with City Cab staff.</p>

<h4>Dangerous Behavior and Physical Abuse</h4>
<p>Dangerous behavior is defined as any threat or action that could cause direct or indirect physical harm to the driver, vehicle, other passengers, or to the person. Physical abuse is defined as any action that could cause direct or indirect physical harm to a passenger, driver, or City Cab staff.</p>

<h4>Verbal Abuse</h4>
<p>Verbal abuse is defined as any oral presentation that is offensive to any passenger, driver, or City Cab staff.</p>

<p>The penalty for a proven incident of verbal abuse will be determined by City Cab and Humboldt Transit Authority.  Penalties will range from a warning letter to temporary suspension from Dial-a-Ride service.  Continued verbal abuse will result in the loss of riding priviledges.</p>

<h4>Causes for Refusal of Service</h4>

<p>Dangerous behavior or physical or verbal abuse towards drivers or other passengers on the vehicle by a passenger are grounds for immediate refusal of Dial-a-Ride service.</p>

<p>The penalty for a proven incident of dangerous or unsafe behavior or physical abuse will be determined between City Cab and Humboldt Transit Authority.  The penalty will range from a warning letter to permanent suspension from the Dial-a-Ride program.</p>

<h4>Cancelations/No-Shows</h4>
<p>Please call Dial-a-Ride as soon as possible if you need to cancel your reservation.  By canceling well in advance, you help City Cab Dial-a-Ride improve quality service to all of our customers.</p>

<p>A No-Show happens when riders do not cancel at least two hours in advance or are not available to board within three minutes of the vehicle's arrival within the stated pickup window. City Cab makes every attempt to contact the passenger when a No-Show occurs.</p>

<p>Riders can avoid No-Show situations when they:</p>

<ul>
<li>Review times and dates with the reservations to be sure the information is correct.</li>
<li>Call City Cab and cancel rides as soon as the ride is no longer needed.</li>
<li>Cancel at least 2 hours in advance of the scheduled pickup time.</li>
<li>Are prepared to board at the starting time of the pickup window and within 3 minutes after the bus arrives.</li>
</ul>

<p>Riders who have three or more No-shows within any 90-day period will have their paratransit service suspended for one week. If the No-Show pattern continues, the length of each suspension will increase. When there are circumstances outside the rider's control, it is not considered a No-Show.  If, for some reason, City Cab arrives after your 30-minuete pickup window and you have made other arrangements or canceled your ride, it is not considered a No-Show.</p>

<h3>NO-Show Policy:</h3>

<p>All No-Shows listed below occur within any 90-day period.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>First No-Show:</strong>  Notification will be mailed stating the date and time of the passenger's first No-Show violation.</li>
<li><strong>Second No-Show:</strong>  Notification will be mailed stating the dates and times of the first and second No-Show violations and warn of impending suspension should a third No-Show occur with in the current 90-day time period.</li>
<li><strong>Third No-Show:</strong>  Notification will be mailed stating the dates and times of all three No-Shows and will notify the passenger of the one week suspension.  This letter will include information on the appeal process.</li>
</ul>

<p>Humboldt Transit Authority will contact the passenger to determine the dates of the suspension period. The suspension is applicable to both standing and demand-response trips.</p>

<h3>Mobility Aids and/or Devices</h3>

<p>Mobility aids or devices that cannot be safely secured with transportation tie downs, or that are not safe to carry on the lift, will not be allowed on City Cab vehicles.  If using a scooter, it is strongly encouraged that you transfer to a seat if possible.  If a rider needs assistance with transferring from a scooter or wheelchair to a seat, it is strongly encouraged that he/she bring along an aide/escort to perform this service as City Cab drivers are not allowed to assist.  The overall intent of this guideline is to try to find a safe way to accommodate each passenger.  If no safe method exists for a passenger to board, ride, or disembark a City Cab vehicle, City Cab will provide curb service only.  All passengers using mobility devices are required to use the provided lap belts. It is strongly recommended that shoulder belts be utilized as well.</p>

<h3>How Big Can My Wheelchair or Scooter Be?</h3>

<p>When purchasing a new wheelchair or scooter, riders should consider if it will fit on City Cab vehicles.</p>

<p>Maximum Size:  48 inches long and 30 inches wide<br/>
Maximun Weight: (including occupant): 600 pounds</p>

<br/><img src="wheelchair-dimensions.jpg" width="400" height="285" border="0" />

<p>Any wheelchair larger than this is considered oversized.  Under ADA guidelines, paratransit vehicles and equipment are designed to carry common wheelchairs which fit within these dimensions.  A common wheelchair is defined as any three or four wheeled mobility device up to 48 inches long by 30 inches wide and weighing no more than 600 pounds (including occupant).  City Cab's paratransit vehicles have added safety features which improve lift safety but also prevent drivers from loading oversized chairs.  Therefore, oversized chairs may not fit on the lift, and under the ADA, if the chair is oversized and does not fit on an ADA lift, it is not required to be transported.</p>

<h3>Shopping Carts Allowed</h3>

<p>Below is an example of an appropriately-sized shopping cart.</p>

<br/><img src="shopping-cart.jpeg" width="185" height="273" border="0" />

<h3>Service Animals</h3>

<p>A service animal is defined by the ADA as any guide dog, signal dog, or other animal individually trained to provide assistance to an individual with a disability.  If they meet this definition, animals are considered service animals under the ADA regardless of whether they have been licensed or certified by a state or local government.</p>

<p>It is suggested that when scheduling a trip with Dial-a-Ride please advise the scheduler that a service animal will be riding.  The service animal must be under the control of its team member at all times while in the vehicle (cannot wander around at will), must stay on the floor of the vehicle, and will be removed if showing signs of aggression, ie., growling, snarling, or biting.</p>

<h3>Comments and Suggestions</h3>

<p>Feedback from our riders is one of most valuable sources of information.  Comments and suggestions can be sent to us by mail, fax, in person or by phone. If you would like a response to your comment or suggestion, include your complete name and mailing address and a written response will be provided within 14 days.</p>
